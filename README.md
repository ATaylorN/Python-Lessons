# Lessons 
> (followed a FreeCodeCamp.org tutorial called 'Data Analysis Bootcamp' hosted by 'Alex the Analyst')  

1. **Pandas**  
  Learned how to read different files in Pandas, limit how much information is displayed, sort data, and how to reset the index.  
2. **Python**  
  Learned the basic syntax of Python including things like data types, loops, functions, tuples, etc.
3. **Python Scraper**  
  Built a basic web scraper that pulls information from a table on a Wikipedia page and writes it to a csv file.

## Projects: 

### 💻 Amazon Web Scraper 
Built a web scraper using Python in Jupyter Notebook that checks on a "Got Data?" t-shirt that is for sale on Amazon. It pulls the title, price, rating, and description information, formats the information to make it more readable, and logs the data in a csv file (creating the csv file if it doesn't already exist). I set it up to automatically pull the data once a day and append it to the csv file. There's also code to send an email if the t-shirt's  price drops below $14.00.   

### 📂 Automatic File Sorter 
Input your file path and it will create a seperate folder for png, csv, and text files and then seperate those files into their respective folders. 

### 🏋️‍♀️ BMI Calculator 
Your standard body mass index (BMI) calculator written in Python. It'll prompt the user their name, weight in pounds, and height in inches, and then let you know what category you fall in.

### 📈 Crypto Currency API and Visualization 
Pulls information from a crypto currency API and stores it in a dataframe using Pandas and Python. Set it collect the data once every minute and then append the data to the dataframe. Then worked on cleaning the data and making it more readable and eventually putting the data into charts. (Note: needed to runner it a bit longer for the last chart to actually show data)
